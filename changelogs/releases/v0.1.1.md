### ⚙️  Miscellaneous

- Feat 002 (#6)

* chore(version): version bump.

* fix(cspell): fixed cspell to include project name and namespace as words to avoid them causing the commit spellcheck from failing.

* feat(timestamps): Updates to add both date and year timestamps.

* refactor(template): Template was refactored to use project_slug rather than package_name.  Hopefully this helps improve cookiecutter_project_upgrader.  Also added updates for license file and jinja2-cli extensions.

* fix(funding): removed .github/FUNDING.yml from _copy_without_render.

* fix(cookiecutter): cleaned up the cookiecutter.json file.
