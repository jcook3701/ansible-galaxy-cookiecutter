## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### ⚙️  Miscellaneous

- *(version)* Version bump.

### 🐛 Fixed

- *(cspell)* Fixed cspell to include project name and namespace as words to avoid them causing the commit spellcheck from failing.
- *(funding)* Removed .github/FUNDING.yml from _copy_without_render.
- *(cookiecutter)* Cleaned up the cookiecutter.json file.

### 🚀 Added

- *(timestamps)* Updates to add both date and year timestamps.

### 🚜 Refactoring

- *(template)* Template was refactored to use project_slug rather than package_name.  Hopefully this helps improve cookiecutter_project_upgrader.  Also added updates for license file and jinja2-cli extensions.
